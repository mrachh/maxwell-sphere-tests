This repository contains codes to verify analytical expressions
of layer potentials for various maxwell kernels arising on the sphere.

The results are consolidated in main.tex, [main.pdf](main.pdf).

In order to run the codes, you will need to install the FMM3D
(https://github.com/flatironinstitute/FMM3D), and fmm3dbie
(https://gitlab.com/fastalgorithms/fmm3dbie) libraries. This can be done
via running ``make install'' after downloading the two repositories.
